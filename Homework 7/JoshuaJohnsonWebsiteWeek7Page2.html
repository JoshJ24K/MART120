    <h1><span>"Something in the Corner"</span></h1>
    <p>I came home after a long day of work. I set my things down by the door as I normally do. I turned on the TV to wind down and watch some relaxing media. I chose to watch a calming show I needed that after the day I had. There was something concerning, however. Everytime the show would cut to a different shot, leaving the screen black, there was something in the corner of my living room. I could barely make it out. I tried not to pay any attention to it, but that proved impossible. It was tall and streched all the way to the ceiling. But when I looked behind me, I saw nothing. As I watched the show and occasionaly saw the figure in the corner, it seemed to get closer to the screen. I could see its eyes reflecting orange on the screen. The eyes in the reflection suddenly looked at me, into my own eyes. The TV turned off, and the figure was no longer looking back at me. But ever since then, I feel like something is watching me.
